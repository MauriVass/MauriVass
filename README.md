<h1 align="center"> Hi there 👋<br/> </h1> 

I am a Data Science student with a strong passion for data and science. During my spare time I devour books and expand my horizons by studying always new things. I am fascinated by the world of productivity and investements. <br/>
Well, I wish I had 48 hours per day, but I have to settle for 24!
